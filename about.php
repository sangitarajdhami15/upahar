    <p>Why do children get so many vaccinations? <br>
    Your child needs different vaccinations to protect them from many different and serious diseases. Vaccines prevent around 2 to 3 million deaths around the world each year.

    Some vaccines need more than one dose at different ages to give your child long-term protection.

    Children get more vaccines today than in the past because there are more vaccines available today. This is because our ability to stop diseases has improved as medical research continues to improve.</p>
